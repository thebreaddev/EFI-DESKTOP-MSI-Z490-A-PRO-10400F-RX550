# Notes
- macOS 10.15.x, 11.x, 12.x 13.4 and lower is untested but should be fine, read note about SSDT-PLUG.aml.
- Works with macOS 13.5 and 13.4.1 (c)
- Sleep works with Intel XMP (Profle 1 - 3200 MHz)
- SSDT-PLUG.aml is not required on macOS 12.3 and up. But i still use it for 12.2 and below compatibility, you can remove it if you don't want to use Monterey.
- Use iMacPro or MacPro SMBIOS (Discrete Graphics only) or iMac20,x SMBIOS (only if have CPU with Integrated Graphics) for hardware decoding/encoding to work.
- and yeah i got Lexa core GPU why not if it works
- generate your SMBIOS info with great utility called [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) by CorpNewt.
